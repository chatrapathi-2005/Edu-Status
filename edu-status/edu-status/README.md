## Project Overview
Edu Status is a responsive and feature-rich web application designed to simplify various student services like **No Dues Clearance**, **Bonafide Certificates**, **Fee Balance Information**, and **Attendance Management**. Built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), this application provides seamless interaction for students and admin users, with secure authentication and user-friendly design.

## Features

### Authentication
- **User Login/Signup**: Validates users and prompts non-registered users to sign up.
- Prevents duplicate applications for **No Dues** and **Bonafide Certificates** on the same day.

### Dashboard (Student Portal)
1. **No Dues Clearance**:
   - Form submission with student details.
   - Provides status tracking and a downloadable PDF with a placeholder for the principalâ€™s signature.
2. **Bonafide Certificate**:
   - Form submission with student details and purpose validation.
   - Status tracking and downloadable digitally signed PDF.
3. **Fees Balance**:
   - Displays detailed fee structure (tuition, bus, hostel, etc.) based on user input.
   - Generates and downloads a PDF report of fee details.
4. **Attendance Maintenance**:
   - Displays attendance percentage, present/absent days, and fines.
   - Allows report download for reference.

### Admin Panel
- Manages student records.
- Tracks submitted forms and application statuses.
- Restricts application resubmissions.

### Additional Features
- **Validation**: Only 3rd-year, 5th-semester students can apply for services.
- **Design**:
  - Header with the app name, "Edu Status", and a placeholder for a logo.
  - Interactive card-based navigation with hover effects.
  - Footer with placeholders for contact information and college logo.
- **PDF Generation**:
  - No Dues and Bonafide forms include placeholders for a digital principal's signature.
- **Database**:
  - Seeded with student data (Roll Numbers: CB2201 to CB2262) and preconfigured validations.
  - Randomized data for fees, attendance, and other attributes.
